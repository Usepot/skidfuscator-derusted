/**
 * Runtime self-integrity helper injected into obfuscated output.
 *
 * <p>Each protected class A contains, in its {@code <clinit>}, a call to
 * {@link #verify(Class, long)}, {@link #verifyExit(Class, long)} or
 * {@link #verifySilent(Class, long)} naming a <em>different</em> class B and B's
 * expected whole-file checksum. At runtime A reads B's on-disk {@code .class}
 * bytes, hashes them, and reacts if the hash no longer matches — so patching B
 * trips a checker that lives in A (a cross-class mesh).</p>
 *
 * <p>The three reactions trade visibility for immediacy: {@code verify} raises
 * an error and {@code verifyExit} halts the JVM <em>at the check site</em> (loud,
 * but the crash stack points straight at the check); {@code verifySilent} instead
 * lets the check return normally and arms a deferred, off-thread reaction, so the
 * failure surfaces later and elsewhere (see {@link #verifySilent}).</p>
 *
 * <p>The hash is {@link LongHashFunction#xx3()} over the entire class file, the
 * same primitive the rest of the SDK already relies on for build/runtime hash
 * agreement. The helper is deliberately lenient when the target resource cannot
 * be read (exploded runs, agents, odd class loaders): it never raises a false
 * positive in those cases.</p>
